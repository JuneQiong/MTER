# MTER

The processed Yelp dataset is included in yelp_restaurant_recursive_entry_sigir. Directly run MTER_tripletensor_tucker.py in model_codes to test our MTER model by tunning hyper parameters.

Please refer to our paper ['Explainable Recommendation via Multi-Task Learning in Opinionated Text Data'](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3210010) for more details.

This is the original version. Later we will release more organized and efficient implementations. Feel free to email me if any confusions. Thank you!
